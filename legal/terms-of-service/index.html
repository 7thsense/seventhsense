Where a price change applies to you, we will charge or invoice you under the new price structure, starting with the next Billing Period in the Subscription Term, except as provided below under 'Fee Adjustments During a Billing Period'. In order to avoid additional charges, you should purchase the appropriate tier of Subscription Service for your anticipated needs. We will monitor or audit remotely the number of Contacts in the Subscription Service. This information is also available to you on the dashboard of the Seventh Sense application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fee Adjustments in Next Billing Period</strong>. If you exceed your Maximum Contacts in a Billing Period, then your Subscription Fee will be adjusted at the beginning of the next Billing Period up to the current base package and tier price which corresponds with the maximum number of Contacts from the prior Billing Period. This process will continue for each Billing Period during the Subscription Term. Our pricing and limits will be as set forth at <a href=https://theseventhsense.com/pricing class=bare>https://theseventhsense.com/pricing</a>. We determine the number of Contacts in the Subscription Service and the number of emails you sent. At your request, we will provide you with the detail we used to reach our conclusion. Once increased, your Subscription Fee will not decrease, even if there is a subsequent reduction in the number of Contacts or emails sent.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fee Adjustments During a Billing Period</strong>.
