It&apos;s no secret that we create data day in and day out that is being captured and used to profile our behavior.  Whether that be when we&apos;re more likely to take a vacation, buy a book on Amazon, buy a new iPhone, or even if we&apos;re about to have a baby.  More and more we are finding ways to gain value from previously ignored data.  Take, for instance, one of my favorite movies, &quot;Moneyball&quot;.  Billy Beane took the A&apos;s to the playoffs on a shoestring budget by looking at the data no-one else was looking at.  Baseball has never been the same since.

<strong>What Billy Beane did to baseball I&apos;ve set out to do with communication data.</strong> Understand it in every way, shape and form.  And then, help people take action on that data to be more productive. 

I started this journey by analyzing my own email archive trying to understand when (from time of day and day of week) my contacts were interacting with me.  I then engaged with some of them to try to understand the behavior underlying their visible activity.

The above is a communication profile (what I call them) of a sales leader over the course of one year. We&apos;ll call him &quot;Joe&quot;.  When I asked why there was a break between 10-11AM, Joe started to laugh.  When pressed, he responded, &quot;now that I think about it, that&apos;s when I take a &apos;bathroom break&apos; and catch up on ESPN&quot;.  Talk about being &quot;regular&quot;  (7 days a week!) &hellip; Note to self, don&apos;t bother trying to schedule a 10AM meeting with Joe.

The above highlights an old colleague that LOVES his lunch break. Let&apos;s call him Brian.  On Monday, lunch starts a little late at 1PM since he usually has a &quot;case of the Monday&apos;s&quot; and gets in a little late.  Of course on Wednesdays and Fridays, he likes to get in a two hour lunch. Clearly if I want to catch Brian, I can either buy him lunch or keep it to 9-5.

Other people are just incredibly regimented.  Based on over 1400 emails sent by this old customer, it&apos;s clear that 2PM is when he clears his inbox. Again, 7 days a week! I didn&apos;t ask him if he was clearing his inbox instead of catching up on ESPN from the bathroom, but at least I do know when to deliver my email to hit the top of his inbox when he&apos;s paying attention and most likely to respond.

Finally, here&apos;s my profile when I was working on building our company as a &quot;nights and weekends&quot; project (i.e. when I still had a paying job). I imagine those late nights and long weekends will be familiar to most entrepreneurs. Do you think reaching me about The Seventh Sense after 8PM would have been effective?
