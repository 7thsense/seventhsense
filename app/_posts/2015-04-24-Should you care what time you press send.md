<p>As a career salesperson, nothing was worse than hearing from an existing or prospective client days after I sent an email and being asked  &quot;where&apos;s your proposal?&quot;.  I knew it meant an immediate loss in trust and a slipped sales cycle. My usual response, &quot;I sent it to you at 9AM on Monday and left a follow up voicemail&quot; and the following reply of &quot;oh, there it is...I usually have all day meetings on Mondays and don&apos;t check emails till after the kids go to bed&quot; helped to repair the trust (partially), but I could never get back the time lost in the sales cycle.</p>

<p>Sound familiar? How about when my sales leader asked &quot;What&apos;s the status on the opportunity with Lisa?&quot; and I&apos;d happily respond &quot;I sent her an email at 10PM last night as I cleared my strategic emails from the day&quot;.</p>  

<p>Unfortunately, my late night diligence resulted in my email being buried below my 5 competitors, LinkedIn updates (they&apos;re always sent between 1-2AM and 5-7AM) and 30 emails from her colleagues with high priority associated with them. Unbeknownst to me, Lisa had a break in her schedule to sit down and respond to emails and answer calls at 2PM (her normal schedule on Tuesday), which is just enough time to get through the top 1/4 of her inbox.</p>  

<p>This won&apos;t come as a surprise, but the number and medium of communications we receive daily is completely overwhelming. It&apos;s a virtual bombardment 24 hours a day and we simply can&apos;t respond to or even get through it all. For sales professionals this results in countless hours writing emails that get buried in our recipients&apos; inboxes and leaving voicemails that never get returned.</p>

<p>The good news is humans are predictable. We get up, commute, hold meetings and keep personal commitments at set times each day, AND we also have predictable communication patterns, resulting in our response rates being greater at certain times each day of the week.</p>

<p>As professionals we generate data every day that can illuminate these patterns. We designed The Seventh Sense to harness that data and help you take easy actions that can increase your sales, improve your efficiency and overall morale. We&apos;ve found that sending emails at the right time increases the chance of a response by over 38% across the board, and in many key situations makes the difference between closed-won and closed-lost.</p>

<p>If timing is everything, isn&apos;t the last leg knowing when???  I&apos;ve found that the answer is a resounding yes, and invite you to find out for yourself.</p>
