<p>In general, people are bombarded with email. According to research by <a href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Email-Statistics-Report-2015-2019-Executive-Summary.pdf" target="_blank">The Radicati Group</a>, the average business professional receives and sends 122 emails per day, while C-level executives receive 3-6 times that number.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3045439/work-smart/the-5-things-your-emails-need-to-include-to-get-people-to-read-and-respond" target="_blank">Fast Company</a> recently mentioned a study showing that <a href="http://media.dmnews.com/documents/20/50plus-email-marketing-statist_4897.pdf" target="_blank">55%</a> of all email users admit that they don&rsquo;t open and read messages regularly&mdash;whether business or personal. These days, maintaining "inbox zero" means you&rsquo;re either OCD or in sales.</p>
<p>What happens when your prospects sit down to check email after a morning of meetings, and your email is buried under 50+ other emails, a few of which are from your competitors? You can probably guess.</p>
<p>Ill-mail is what we call email sent at a bad time. Marketers are notorious for sending ill-mail. We all read the same best practices and follow the same &ldquo;best time to send&rdquo; advice (based on averages of widely-varying individual habits). So marketers tend to send at the same time &mdash; resulting in overflowing inboxes at predictable intervals.</p>
<p>Ill-mail is a problem for three reasons: it results in annoyed prospects or customers, graymail and unsubscribes.</p>
<p><strong>Unopened Email: Graymail</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-graymail-ht" target="_blank">Graymail</a> is email you opted in to receive (because you downloaded a report, an eBook or something) but don&#39;t really want, or think you don&rsquo;t want what is to follow. You opted in to get the content behind the form. You don&rsquo;t hate them enough to unsubscribe because you did appreciate the content, however you open or engage in 1 out of 10. Maybe you just don&#39;t care or haven&rsquo;t noticed them due to the time they landed in your inbox.</p>
<p>Graymail is a big deal because the emails you&rsquo;re sending to these recipients will end up directly in their &ldquo;junk&rdquo; folders &mdash; most email servers now automatically detect graymail and immediately filter it. Your graymail recipients won&rsquo;t even see your emails any more. And servers tag senders of graymail. Even brand new subscribers who are on the same server will have your emails directly deposited into their &ldquo;junk&rdquo; folders.</p>
<p>Although graymail traps are intended to filter out emails that people don&rsquo;t want, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that all the recipients not opening or engaging in your emails truly don&rsquo;t care. You may just be sending at a bad time. If your email is buried under a pile of other emails, the chances of getting that email opened are slim.</p>
<p><strong>Unsubscribes</strong></p>
<p>Not all unsubscribes are bad. You&rsquo;d be better off having recipients unsubscribe if they don&rsquo;t find your content applicable than having recipients simply ignore your emails, turning you into a graymail sender. </p>However, what you don&rsquo;t want to happen is for perfectly good contacts who are ideal prospects or existing customers to unsubscribe simply because they&rsquo;re overwhelmed with email.</p>
<p>If business professionals encounter a full inbox and they&rsquo;ve got a busy, stressful day ahead, they&rsquo;re likely to get frustrated and do a mass-unsubscribe to try and deal with what&rsquo;s causing them additional stress. You don&rsquo;t want your email to be sitting there with 100 others. You want yours to arrive at the best time for each individual &mdash; when they&rsquo;re relaxed, and ready to engage.</p>
<p><strong>The Ideal Time Is Different for Everyone</strong></p>
<p>As we mentioned, &ldquo;best time to send&rdquo; advice is based on averages. But every industry is different, and every individual has his or her own <a href="http://www.theseventhsense.com/blog/2015/11/23/its-better-at-the-top-the-psychology-of-inbox-priority/" target="_blank">personal email habits</a>, making it impossible for there to be a single best time for everyone.</p>
<p>In order to avoid ill-mail, there are two steps you can take.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Randomize delivery times to learn what the best average time is for your particular list.</li>
 <li>Customize your delivery times for each individual.</li>
</ol>
<p>You work hard on your email marketing and sales emails to have them end up in &ldquo;junk&rdquo; folders or the trash.</p>
