<p>Marketing automation systems; Marketo, Constant Contact, Mail Chimp, Eloqua, Act-On, Hubspot, etc. have been using email open tracking for years as a way to measure success of their email campaigns.</p> 

<p>In recent years, there has been a lot of innovation in sales optimization technologies that are now bringing this same sophistication to sales professionals.  I&apos;m a huge fan of Yesware, Boomerang, Hubspot Sidekick (my favorite) and Toutapp.  If you are in sales and haven&apos;t heard of these, you should definitely check them out.  That said, you need to be aware of the pitfalls of using &apos;email opens&apos; as a way of figuring out whether prospective or existing customers are truly engaging in your email communications.</p>

<p>In this first post, we&apos;ll review how these technologies work and how they don&apos;t.   A transparent pixel (think of this as a small picture you can&apos;t see) is embedded in your email.  Once you check a box that says &quot;track my email&quot; and your recipient opens your email, the pixel (picture) is downloaded from a remote server which notifies you that the email was opened.  Sounds great, doesn&apos;t it?</p>

<p>Not so fastâ€¦.Based on your audience&apos;s email application, interface and knowledge, it can have adverse effects.  Below is a quick synopsis of &quot;how it works&quot;.</p>

<ol class="mt20 mb20">
	<li>Microsoft Outlook &mdash; By default, images aren&apos;t downloaded due to security concerns (ever seen the below?).  It&apos;s up to the Outlook user to click the &apos;download pictures&apos; button in order to receive a notification that the email was read.</li>
	<li>Gmail &mdash; If your recipient has Gmail as their backend email provider, Google used to automatically download the pixel (picture) as soon as the email was delivered to a Google server versus read by the intended recipient, but that is no longer the case &mdash; BIG WIN for sales and marketing professionals using an email open tracking feature.</li>
	<li>Mobile &mdash; Mobile email applications download the pixel by default as soon as the user opens your email.</li>
</ol>

<p>Still sounds great doesn&apos;t it?  It&apos;s certainly a start, however using this as your only way to understand your audience&apos;s behavior can trick you.</p> 

<p>In my next post, we&apos;ll put you in your audience&apos;s shoes to show you the pitfalls.</p>
